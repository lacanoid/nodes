GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>make</b> [
<b>−f</b> <i>makefile</i> ] [ options ] ... [ targets
] ...</p>

<h2>WARNING
<a name="WARNING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This man page
is an extract of the documentation of GNU <i>make</i>. It is
updated only occasionally, because the GNU project does not
use nroff. For complete, current documentation, refer to the
Info file <b>make.info</b> which is made from the Texinfo
source file <b>make.texi</b>.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The purpose of
the <i>make</i> utility is to determine automatically which
pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issue
the commands to recompile them. The manual describes the GNU
implementation of <i>make</i>, which was written by Richard
Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is currently maintained by
Paul Smith. Our examples show C programs, since they are
most common, but you can use <i>make</i> with any
programming language whose compiler can be run with a shell
command. In fact, <i>make</i> is not limited to programs.
You can use it to describe any task where some files must be
updated automatically from others whenever the others
change.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To prepare to
use <i>make</i>, you must write a file called the
<i>makefile</i> that describes the relationships among files
in your program, and the states the commands for updating
each file. In a program, typically the executable file is
updated from object files, which are in turn made by
compiling source files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once a suitable
makefile exists, each time you change some source files,
this simple shell command:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>make</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">suffices to
perform all necessary recompilations. The <i>make</i>
program uses the makefile data base and the
last-modification times of the files to decide which of the
files need to be updated. For each of those files, it issues
the commands recorded in the data base.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>make</i>
executes commands in the <i>makefile</i> to update one or
more target <i>names</i>, where <i>name</i> is typically a
program. If no <b>−f</b> option is present,
<i>make</i> will look for the makefiles <i>GNUmakefile</i>,
<i>makefile</i>, and <i>Makefile</i>, in that order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally you
should call your makefile either <i>makefile</i> or
<i>Makefile</i>. (We recommend <i>Makefile</i> because it
appears prominently near the beginning of a directory
listing, right near other important files such as
<i>README</i>.) The first name checked, <i>GNUmakefile</i>,
is not recommended for most makefiles. You should use this
name if you have a makefile that is specific to GNU
<i>make</i>, and will not be understood by other versions of
<i>make</i>. If <i>makefile</i> is ’−’,
the standard input is read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>make</i>
updates a target if it depends on prerequisite files that
have been modified since the target was last modified, or if
the target does not exist.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>−b</b>,
<b>−m</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">These options are ignored for
compatibility with other versions of <i>make</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−B</b>,
<b>−−always−make</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Unconditionally make all
targets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−C</b> <i>dir</i>,
<b>−−directory</b>=<i>dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Change to directory <i>dir</i>
before reading the makefiles or doing anything else. If
multiple <b>−C</b> options are specified, each is
interpreted relative to the previous one: <b>−C</b> /
<b>−C</b> etc is equivalent to <b>−C</b> /etc.
This is typically used with recursive invocations of
<i>make</i>.</p>

<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>Print debugging information in addition to normal
processing. The debugging information says which files are
being considered for remaking, which file-times are being
compared and with what results, which files actually need to
be remade, which implicit rules are considered and which are
applied---everything interesting about how <i>make</i>
decides what to do.</p></td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−−debug</b><i>[=FLAGS]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Print debugging information in
addition to normal processing. If the <i>FLAGS</i> are
omitted, then the behavior is the same as if <b>−d</b>
was specified. <i>FLAGS</i> may be <i>a</i> for all
debugging output (same as using <b>−d</b>), <i>b</i>
for basic debugging, <i>v</i> for more verbose basic
debugging, <i>i</i> for showing implicit rules, <i>j</i> for
details on invocation of commands, and <i>m</i> for
debugging while remaking makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−e</b>,
<b>−−environment−overrides</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Give variables taken from the
environment precedence over variables from makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−f</b> <i>file</i>,
<b>−−file</b>=<i>file</i>,
<b>−−makefile</b>=<i>FILE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use <i>file</i> as a
makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−i</b>,
<b>−−ignore−errors</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Ignore all errors in commands
executed to remake files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−I</b> <i>dir</i>,
<b>−−include−dir</b>=<i>dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies a directory
<i>dir</i> to search for included makefiles. If several
<b>−I</b> options are used to specify several
directories, the directories are searched in the order
specified. Unlike the arguments to other flags of
<i>make</i>, directories given with <b>−I</b> flags
may come directly after the flag: <b>−I</b><i>dir</i>
is allowed, as well as <b>−I</b> <i>dir.</i> This
syntax is allowed for compatibility with the C
preprocessor’s <b>−I</b> flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−j</b> [<i>jobs</i>],
<b>−−jobs</b>[=<i>jobs</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies the number of
<i>jobs</i> (commands) to run simultaneously. If there is
more than one <b>−j</b> option, the last one is
effective. If the <b>−j</b> option is given without an
argument, <i>make</i> will not limit the number of jobs that
can run simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−k</b>,
<b>−−keep−going</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Continue as much as possible
after an error. While the target that failed, and those that
depend on it, cannot be remade, the other dependencies of
these targets can be processed all the same.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−l</b> [<i>load</i>],
<b>−−load−average</b>[=<i>load</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies that no new jobs
(commands) should be started if there are others jobs
running and the load average is at least <i>load</i> (a
floating-point number). With no argument, removes a previous
load limit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−L</b>,
<b>−−check−symlink−times</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use the latest mtime between
symlinks and target.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−n</b>,
<b>−−just−print</b>,
<b>−−dry−run</b>,
<b>−−recon</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Print the commands that would
be executed, but do not execute them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−o</b> <i>file</i>,
<b>−−old−file</b>=<i>file</i>,
<b>−−assume−old</b>=<i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Do not remake the file
<i>file</i> even if it is older than its dependencies, and
do not remake anything on account of changes in <i>file</i>.
Essentially the file is treated as very old and its rules
are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−p</b>,
<b>−−print−data−base</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Print the data base (rules and
variable values) that results from reading the makefiles;
then execute as usual or as otherwise specified. This also
prints the version information given by the <b>−v</b>
switch (see below). To print the data base without trying to
remake any files, use <b>make −p
−f</b><i>/dev/null.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−q</b>,
<b>−−question</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">’’Question
mode’’. Do not run any commands, or print
anything; just return an exit status that is zero if the
specified targets are already up to date, nonzero
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−r</b>,
<b>−−no−builtin−rules</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Eliminate use of the
built−in implicit rules. Also clear out the default
list of suffixes for suffix rules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−R</b>,
<b>−−no−builtin−variables</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Don’t define any
built−in variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−s</b>,
<b>−−silent</b>, <b>−−quiet</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Silent operation; do not print
the commands as they are executed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−S</b>,
<b>−−no−keep−going</b>,
<b>−−stop</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Cancel the effect of the
<b>−k</b> option. This is never necessary except in a
recursive <i>make</i> where <b>−k</b> might be
inherited from the top-level <i>make</i> via MAKEFLAGS or if
you set <b>−k</b> in MAKEFLAGS in your
environment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−t</b>,
<b>−−touch</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Touch files (mark them up to
date without really changing them) instead of running their
commands. This is used to pretend that the commands were
done, in order to fool future invocations of
<i>make</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−v</b>,
<b>−−version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Print the version of the
<i>make</i> program plus a copyright, a list of authors and
a notice that there is no warranty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−w</b>,
<b>−−print−directory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Print a message containing the
working directory before and after other processing. This
may be useful for tracking down errors from complicated
nests of recursive <i>make</i> commands.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−−no−print−directory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Turn off <b>−w</b>, even
if it was turned on implicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−W</b> <i>file</i>,
<b>−−what−if</b>=<i>file</i>,
<b>−−new−file</b>=<i>file</i>,
<b>−−assume−new</b>=<i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Pretend that the target
<i>file</i> has just been modified. When used with the
<b>−n</b> flag, this shows you what would happen if
you were to modify that file. Without <b>−n</b>, it is
almost the same as running a <i>touch</i> command on the
given file before running <i>make</i>, except that the
modification time is changed only in the imagination of
<i>make</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>−−warn−undefined−variables</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Warn when an undefined variable
is referenced.</p>

<h2>EXIT STATUS
<a name="EXIT STATUS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GNU <i>make</i>
exits with a status of zero if all makefiles were
successfully parsed and no targets that were built failed. A
status of one will be returned if the <b>−q</b> flag
was used and <i>make</i> determines that a target needs to
be rebuilt. A status of two will be returned if any errors
were encountered.</p>
