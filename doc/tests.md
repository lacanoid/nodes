USE CASES
=========


Creating and editing a new html file
------------------------------------

- Can't create new file. Hacking. Used "touch index.html". 
  Add menu with templates from Templates directory.

+ Save ^S should close file and go back to preview. Confusing. Had to use back button+reload.

- When going back to editor again, cursor position is lost. Annoying. 
  Create localStorage for VC current focus(es), so that it can be stored there.

Playing a video from iPad
-------------------------

- Login doesn't quite work, no redirect (also on Mac safari)
- Icons are somewhat missaligned
- Can't change directories on touch device
- Add button to start the player
